|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Semi-Automated Documentation**                | Leverages PHP attributes to generate OpenAPI documentation with minimal configuration.                                   |
| **Model-Aware Operations**                      | Automatically associates routes and parameters with Eloquent models for intelligent documentation generation.            |
| **Flexible Parameter Management**               | Detects route parameters, automatically assigns types, and generates descriptions with the ability to override globally. |
| **Request & Response Handling**                 | Automates OpenAPI property definitions for request classes and resource responses based on rules and model attributes.   |
| **Built-in Validation**                         | Ensures all controllers, request classes, and responses adhere to defined documentation rules and highlights discrepancies.|
| **SDK Generation**                              | Generates TypeScript SDKs for front-end integration, including prebuilt methods for API calls (e.g., `createUser()`).    |
| **Predefined Responses**                        | Comes with customizable default responses like `ValidationError`, `Unauthorized`, and more.                             |
| **Customizable Workflow**                       | Supports custom route discovery, parameter overrides, and developer-defined extensions for unique project needs.         |
| **Global Configuration**                        | Offers configuration for overriding parameter definitions, request behavior, and other package behavior.                |
| **CLI Warnings and Reports**                    | Highlights issues like undefined parameters or missing descriptions directly in the CLI.                                |

## **Why Laravel Doc Kit?**

- **Time-Saving:** Focus on building your application while Laravel Doc Kit handles the repetitive parts of API documentation.
- **Flexible:** Use predefined rules or customize behavior to match your projectâ€™s structure and conventions.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Clean syntax, powerful defaults, and detailed documentation ensure a smooth experience.

---

## **Planned Features**

This package is still under development. Here's a glimpse of what's coming:

- **Dynamic OpenAPI Documentation:** Fully generated OpenAPI YAML/JSON files for integration with tools like Swagger UI or Postman.
- **Advanced SDK Versioning:** Include semantic versioning for SDKs, ensuring compatibility across environments.
- **Custom Processor Extensibility:** Allow developers to define custom Swagger processors for their specific needs.
- **Detailed Warnings:** CLI-based warnings for undocumented endpoints, inconsistent parameter definitions, and more.

## **How It Works**

Laravel Doc Kit uses a combination of PHP attributes and smart defaults to document your API. Developers can define documentation attributes directly in controllers, request classes, and resources, while the package handles the heavy lifting.
